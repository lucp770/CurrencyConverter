#Real Time Currency converter

This is an application built in React Js, Material Ui and  using the exchange rates API.

The site is depployed in Netlify and can be accessed at the link: https://master--realtime-currency-converter.netlify.app/


PS: The API has a limited use, so if the site stays loading indefinetly probably is because it has reached the maximum number of requests for the API and cannot be used right now.
